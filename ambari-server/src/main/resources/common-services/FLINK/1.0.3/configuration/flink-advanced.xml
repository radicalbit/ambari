    <property>
        <name>taskmanager.memory.size</name>
        <value>-1</value>
        <description>The amount of memory (in megabytes) that the task manager reserves on the JVM’s heap space for
            sorting, hash tables, and caching of intermediate results. If unspecified (-1), the memory manager will
            take a fixed ratio of the heap memory available to the JVM,
            as specified by taskmanager.memory.fraction.</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>taskmanager.memory.fraction</name>
        <value>0.7</value>
        <description>The relative amount of memory that the task manager reserves for sorting,
            hash tables, and caching of intermediate results. For example,
            a value of 0.8 means that TaskManagers reserve 80% of the JVM’s heap space
            for internal data buffers, leaving 20% of the JVM’s heap space free for
            objects created by user-defined functions. This parameter is only evaluated,
            if taskmanager.memory.size is not set.</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>taskmanager.memory.segment-size</name>
        <value>32768</value>
        <description>The size of memory buffers used by the memory manager and the network stack in bytes</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>taskmanager.memory.preallocate</name>
        <value>false</value>
        <description>Can be either of true or false. Specifies whether task managers should
            allocate all managed memory when starting up.</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>taskmanager.tmp.dirs</name>
        <value>/tmp</value>
        <description>The directory for temporary files, or a list of directories separated by the systems
            directory delimiter (for example ‘:’ (colon) on Linux/Unix). If multiple directories are specified,
            then the temporary files will be distributed across the directories in a round-robin fashion.
            The I/O manager component will spawn one reading and one writing thread per directory.
            A directory may be listed multiple times to have the I/O manager use multiple threads
            for it (for example if it is physically stored on a very fast disc or RAID)</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>taskmanager.network.numberOfBuffers</name>
        <value>2048</value>
        <description>The number of buffers available to the network stack.
            This number determines how many streaming data exchange channels a TaskManager
            can have at the same time and how well buffered the channels are. If a job is
            rejected or you get a warning that the system has not enough buffers available,
            increase this value</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>state.backend</name>
        <value>filesystem</value>
        <description>The backend that will be used to store operator state checkpoints if
            checkpointing is enabled. Supported backends: filesystem, jobmanager</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>blob.storage.directory</name>
        <value></value>
        <description>Directory for storing blobs (such as user jar’s) on the TaskManagers.</description>
        <value-attributes>
            <empty-value-valid>true</empty-value-valid>
        </value-attributes>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>blob.server.port</name>
        <value>0</value>
        <description>Port definition for the blob server (serving user jar’s) on the Taskmanagers.
            By default the port is set to 0, which means that the operating system is
            picking an ephemeral port. Flink also accepts a list of ports (“50100,50101”),
            ranges (“50100-50200”) or a combination of both. It is recommended to set a
            range of ports to avoid collisions when multiple JobManagers are running on
            the same machine.</description>
    </property>

    <property>
        <name>fs.output.always-create-directory</name>
        <value>false</value>
        <description>File writers running with a parallelism larger than one create a directory
            for the output file path and put the different result files (one per parallel writer task)
            into that directory. If this option is set to true, writers with a parallelism of
            1 will also create a directory and place a single result file into it. If the option
            is set to false, the writer will directly create the file directly at the output path,
            without creating a containing directory.</description>
