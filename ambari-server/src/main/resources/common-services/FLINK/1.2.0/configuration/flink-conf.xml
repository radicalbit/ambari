        <description>Defines the high availability mode used for the cluster execution. Currently,
            Flink supports the following modes: ‘none‘ (default): No high availability. A single JobManager
            runs and no JobManager state is checkpointed. ‘zookeeper‘: Supports the execution of multiple
            JobManagers and JobManager state checkpointing. Among the group of JobManagers, ZooKeeper
            elects one of them as the leader which is responsible for the cluster execution. In
            case of a JobManager failure, a standby JobManager will be elected as the new leader
            and is given the last checkpointed JobManager state. In order to use the ‘zookeeper’ mode,
            it is mandatory to also define the high-availability.zookeeper.quorum configuration
            value.</description>
